  An Elixir supervisor has just one purpose â€” it manages one or more worker
  processes including other supervisors.

  At its simplest, a supervisor is a process that uses the OTP supervisor
  behavior. It is given a list of processes to monitor and is told what to do
  if a process dies, and how to prevent restart loops (when a process is
  restarted, dies, gets restarted, dies, and so on).
